You bought an EV but you live in an apartment, condo, or townhome. Now what? Charging at a multi-family property is more complicated than plugging in at a single-family garage -- but it is absolutely doable. We have installed chargers in Henderson apartment garages, condo parking structures, and HOA common areas. This guide covers every option, from the dead-simple to the full shared charging buildout.

## The Real Challenges of Multi-Family EV Charging

Multi-family properties come with obstacles that house owners do not deal with:

- **You may not own your parking space** -- it could be assigned, shared, or unassigned
- **Parking garage electrical infrastructure** was never designed for EV loads
- **You need approval** from your landlord, property manager, or HOA board
- **Electricity billing** gets complicated fast when meters are shared
- **Running wiring** to parking spaces often means significant conduit work through concrete and across distances

None of these are dealbreakers. More Henderson apartment and condo residents are charging EVs every month. Here are the paths that work.

## Option 1: Level 1 Charging (Standard 120V Outlet)

The simplest approach: plug your EV's portable charger into a standard 120V outlet near your parking space.

### When This Works
- Your assigned space has a nearby 120V outlet (common in garages -- they were put there for vacuums and power tools)
- You drive less than 30-40 miles per day
- You can leave the car plugged in 10+ hours overnight
- Your landlord approves

### What to Expect
- **Charging speed**: 3-5 miles of range per hour. Slow, but enough for a light daily commute
- **Electricity cost**: About $1-2 per day of average driving
- **Outlet capacity**: Shared-circuit outlets may trip breakers if multiple residents charge at once. The outlet should be on a dedicated 20A circuit.
- **Permission**: Even using an existing outlet may need landlord approval, especially if electricity is included in rent or billed to the building

### Cost
- **$0** if the outlet exists and you have your car's included portable charger
- **$200-$500** if the building adds a dedicated outlet near your space

At Henderson EV Charger Pros, we work with apartment buildings and property managers across Clark County. We handle the permitting, NV Energy coordination, and installation. Call (702) 555-0134 or fill out the form on our homepage for a free assessment.

## Option 2: Portable Level 2 Charger

If a 240V outlet exists near your parking space -- common in garages with laundry hookups or workshop areas -- you can use a portable Level 2 EVSE and get real charging speed.

### Equipment Options
- **Lectron V-Box** ($299-$379): Portable, plugs into NEMA 14-50 outlets
- **Tesla Mobile Connector** with NEMA 14-50 adapter ($200 + $35 adapter): Tesla owners
- **Other portable Level 2 EVSEs**: $250-$500 from various brands

### When This Works
- A 240V outlet exists within cord reach of your space
- The circuit has enough capacity (40-50A) for EV charging
- Your landlord permits it

### Things to Work Out
- **Electricity billing**: If the outlet is on a shared meter, agree on payment with your landlord. Some add a flat monthly charge; others install a sub-meter ($200-$400).
- **Theft and tampering**: Portable chargers can be unplugged or stolen. Use one with a locking feature and add a cable lock.
- **Cord routing**: A charging cable across a shared garage creates a trip hazard. Use cable covers and route it along walls.

## Option 3: Dedicated EV Charger Installation

This is the best long-term solution. A Level 2 charger installed at your assigned parking space gives you reliable, fast, overnight charging just like a homeowner gets.

### For Renters: Making the Case to Your Landlord

Five things that get landlords to say yes:

1. **Property value**: EV chargers increase desirability and justify higher rents. The National Apartment Association ranks EV charging among the top amenities new renters ask about.

2. **Offer to cover the cost**: A NEMA 14-50 outlet installation runs $350-$900. Many landlords agree when tenants pay. Some will split it.

3. **Zero maintenance**: Once installed, an EV charger needs nothing. The electrical infrastructure stays with the property after you leave.

4. **Nevada law is on your side**: NRS 278.0208 supports the right of property owners to install EV charging equipment and limits unreasonable restrictions from HOAs and local governments.

5. **Put it in writing**: Propose an agreement covering who pays for installation, who pays for electricity (sub-meter or flat fee), what happens when you move out, and liability.

### For Condo Owners: Navigating Your HOA

You own your unit, which gives you more leverage -- but you still need HOA approval.

1. **Read your CC&Rs**: Check for language about exterior modifications, electrical work, or EV chargers.

2. **Know Nevada HOA law**: NRS 116.350 addresses EV charging in common-interest communities:
   - HOAs cannot unreasonably prohibit or restrict EV charger installation
   - The unit owner bears the cost
   - The HOA can require the work meet building codes and use a licensed contractor
   - The HOA can require reasonable insurance provisions

3. **Submit an architectural modification request** with:
   - Description of the proposed installation
   - Conduit location and routing
   - Licensed electrician's plan and credentials
   - Confirmation you will get the City of Henderson permit
   - How electricity will be metered and paid for

4. **Counter common objections**:
   - **"It will damage the building"**: Professional installation uses proper conduit and mounting -- no structural compromise
   - **"Who pays for the electricity?"**: A sub-meter means you pay for exactly what you use
   - **"It's not fair to other residents"**: Any resident can request one. Infrastructure can be shared or expanded.
   - **"Liability?"**: The installation is permitted, inspected, and insured. The homeowner carries liability.

### Shared Charging Solutions for Buildings

For buildings serving multiple EV drivers, shared stations are the most efficient path:

**Networked charging stations** (ChargePoint, Blink, EV Connect):
- Installed in common parking areas
- Each user has an account and pays per kWh
- The HOA or building sets pricing to cover electricity plus a small margin
- Usage data informs future expansion
- Cost: $3,000-$8,000 per station installed

**Power-sharing systems**:
- Multiple plugs share one high-amperage circuit
- Smart management charges every car without overloading the building's electrical system
- Tesla Wall Connector power sharing and ChargePoint load management both do this well
- More cost-effective than running a separate circuit to each space

**"Make-ready" infrastructure**:
- The building installs conduit, wiring, and panel capacity to each parking space
- Individual residents buy and install their own chargers
- Reduces per-unit cost and allows phased rollout
- NV Energy has offered programs supporting make-ready infrastructure in multi-family buildings

## Permit Requirements for Multi-Family Installs

EV charger installations in Henderson apartments and condos need the same electrical permits as single-family homes, plus a few extra considerations:

### City of Henderson Permit
- **Required for**: Any new electrical circuit, single unit or common area
- **Who pulls it**: The licensed electrician -- not the tenant or property owner
- **Fee**: $75-$250 depending on scope

### Additional Requirements in Common Areas
- **Fire department review**: May be required for enclosed parking garages
- **ADA compliance**: At least one common-area charger must be accessible
- **Building code**: Parking structure installations must comply with fire and ventilation codes for enclosed spaces
- **Signage**: Designated EV charging spaces need proper signage per Henderson code

### Electrical Capacity
Older apartment buildings often lack capacity for multiple EV chargers. We evaluate:
- The building's total electrical service
- Current demand from units and common areas
- Available panel space for new circuits
- Whether a service upgrade or dedicated EV panel is needed

If the building needs significant new capacity, NV Energy may have to upgrade the transformer or service line. We handle that coordination.

## Public Charging as a Supplement

If installing a charger at your building is not possible yet, Henderson's public charging network can fill the gap:

### DC Fast Charging
Available along major corridors, especially near:
- 215 Beltway commercial areas
- Green Valley and Anthem shopping centers
- Tesla Supercharger locations

DC fast charging runs $0.30-$0.45/kWh (roughly $10-$18 for a 20-80% charge in 20-45 minutes).

### Level 2 Public Charging
Free or low-cost stations at:
- Henderson shopping centers and retail locations
- City facilities
- Some apartment complexes that already installed shared chargers

Level 2 public charging works if you can leave the car for 2-4 hours while shopping or running errands.

### Workplace Charging
If your employer offers EV charging, this is a strong alternative to home charging. Many Henderson-area employers are adding stations as an employee benefit.

## Cost Estimates for Multi-Family Installations

### Single-Unit Installation (One Parking Space)
- **NEMA 14-50 outlet**: $500-$1,200 (higher than single-family due to longer wire runs and conduit in parking structures)
- **Hardwired Level 2 charger**: $1,200-$3,000
- **Dedicated sub-meter**: Add $200-$400

### Building-Wide Installation (Multiple Chargers)
- **Per-station cost drops with scale**: $2,000-$5,000 per station (vs $3,000-$8,000 for one)
- **Electrical infrastructure**: $5,000-$20,000+ for panel upgrades and conduit runs
- **Networked management**: $500-$2,000 for software and setup
- **10-station installation**: $25,000-$60,000 total

### Financing Options
- **NV Energy programs**: Multi-family charging infrastructure incentives (check current availability)
- **Federal 30C tax credit**: Commercial installations qualify for up to $100,000 per charger (prevailing wage requirements apply)
- **Property improvement loans**: Banks loan against property improvements that add value
- **Resident cost-sharing**: Split infrastructure costs among interested EV-driving residents

## Practical Tips for Apartment EV Owners

1. **Talk to your landlord or HOA before you buy the EV.** Starting early gives you time to work out a charging solution before you need one.

2. **Get everything in writing.** Verbal agreements about charging access and electricity payments lead to disputes.

3. **HOA boards rotate.** If one board rejects your request, resubmit when the board changes. Each year more residents buy EVs, and the pressure builds.

4. **Think about your lease term.** Paying $500-$1,200 for an outlet installation makes sense if you plan to stay 2+ years. For short leases, portable or public charging is more practical.

5. **Team up with other EV owners.** A group request to the HOA or landlord carries more weight and makes shared infrastructure economically viable.

6. **Know your rights.** Nevada law supports EV charger installation. If your HOA unreasonably denies your request, consult an attorney who knows NRS 116.350.

7. **Map public charging near your daily route.** Several Henderson shopping centers offer free Level 2 charging while you shop.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can my HOA legally block me from installing an EV charger in Henderson?
Not unreasonably. Nevada Revised Statute NRS 116.350 prohibits HOAs from unreasonably restricting EV charger installation. They can require licensed contractor work, proper permits, and reasonable insurance, but they cannot flatly deny a reasonable request.

### Who pays for the electricity when I charge at my apartment?
That depends on your setup. If your parking space has its own meter, you pay directly. If it is on a shared meter, work out a flat monthly fee or install a sub-meter ($200-$400) so you pay for exactly what you use.

### How much does it cost to install one EV charger in an apartment parking structure?
A single-unit NEMA 14-50 outlet runs $500-$1,200. A hardwired Level 2 charger runs $1,200-$3,000. Costs are higher than single-family homes because of longer wire runs and conduit requirements in parking structures.

### Can I use a portable charger at my apartment?
Yes, if you have access to a 240V outlet near your parking space and your landlord permits it. A Lectron V-Box ($299-$379) or Tesla Mobile Connector ($235) plugs into a NEMA 14-50 outlet and delivers Level 2 speeds. Secure it with a cable lock.

### Does Henderson require a permit for apartment EV charger installation?
Yes. Any new electrical circuit in Henderson requires a permit, whether it is in a single-family home or a multi-family building. The licensed electrician pulls the permit -- not the tenant or property owner.
