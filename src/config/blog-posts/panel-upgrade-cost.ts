Adding an EV charger, putting in solar, or living in a Henderson home built before 2000? There is a solid chance your electrical panel needs an upgrade. The panel -- your breaker box -- is the hub of your home's electrical system. Upgrading it is one of the most common jobs we do, and one of the most important.

## The Short Answer on Cost

| Upgrade Type | Cost Range |
|-------------|------------|
| 100A to 200A panel upgrade | $1,800 - $3,500 |
| 150A to 200A panel upgrade | $1,500 - $2,800 |
| 200A panel replacement (same size) | $1,200 - $2,500 |
| Adding a subpanel (60A-100A) | $800 - $1,500 |
| 200A to 320A/400A upgrade | $3,500 - $6,000 |

These totals include labor, materials, the City of Henderson permit, and NV Energy coordination. Your actual cost depends on your home's electrical setup, panel location, and scope of work.

## What Is an Electrical Panel Upgrade?

Your electrical panel is the metal box -- usually in the garage, utility room, or on an exterior wall -- that distributes power from NV Energy's service line to every circuit in your house. It holds the breakers that protect each circuit from overloading.

A **panel upgrade** means one or more of these:

- **Increasing amperage**: Going from 100A service to 200A, giving your home more total electrical capacity
- **Replacing the panel**: Swapping an outdated, damaged, or recalled panel for a modern one
- **Adding breaker spaces**: Older panels have 20-24 spaces; modern panels have 30-42+
- **Upgrading the service entrance**: New meter base, service cable, and weatherhead to handle higher amperage

## When Do You Need a Panel Upgrade?

### For EV Charger Installation
This is the number-one reason Henderson homeowners call us about panel upgrades. A Level 2 EV charger needs a **40-60 amp dedicated circuit**. If your panel is near capacity, there is no room for that load.

**You need an upgrade if:**
- Your panel is **100 amps** -- a 48A charger eats nearly half your total capacity
- Your panel has **no available breaker spaces** for a new 240V breaker
- A **load calculation** shows you're at or near capacity with HVAC, water heater, dryer, and range already connected

**You might not need one if:**
- You have a **200A panel** with open breaker spaces
- Existing loads leave enough headroom for a 40-60A circuit
- You choose a charger with **adjustable amperage** set to 24A or 32A instead of 48A

At Henderson EV Charger Pros, we run a load calculation at every assessment -- no guesswork. Call (702) 555-0134 or fill out the form on our homepage for a free on-site evaluation.

### For Solar Panel Installation
Solar is big in Henderson. A solar system needs a dedicated breaker, and the NEC **120% rule** limits how much you can backfeed through your panel. A 100A panel only supports a small solar array under this rule.

### For Aging or Recalled Panels
Some panel brands from the 1960s-1990s have known safety issues:

- **Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) Stab-Lok panels**: Breakers that fail to trip during overloads -- documented fire hazard
- **Zinsco/Sylvania panels**: Breakers can melt and fuse to the bus bar, preventing them from tripping
- **Pushmatic panels**: Outdated design, parts almost impossible to find

If your Henderson home has any of these, replacement is a safety priority regardless of new loads.

### For Home Additions or Remodels
Adding a room, converting a garage, or loading up a kitchen with modern appliances can push demand past your panel's capacity.

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

Here is what goes into a 100A to 200A panel upgrade in Henderson:

### Equipment and Materials ($500 - $1,000)
- **200A panel** (Square D, Siemens, Eaton): $200-$400
- **200A main breaker**: $50-$100
- **New circuit breakers** (transferring existing circuits): $100-$200
- **200A meter base** (if NV Energy requires it): $80-$150
- **Service entrance cable** (SER cable, meter to panel): $100-$250
- **Grounding electrode conductor and rod**: $50-$80
- **Miscellaneous** (connectors, lugs, conduit, hardware): $50-$100

### Labor ($800 - $1,800)
A panel upgrade is a full-day job -- 6-10 hours for an experienced electrician. That covers:
- Removing the old panel and transferring all circuits to the new one
- Installing the new meter base (if needed)
- Running new service entrance cable
- Mounting and wiring the new panel
- Testing every circuit
- Coordinating with NV Energy for meter disconnect/reconnect
- Cleanup and labeling

Henderson electrician rates run **$85-$150 per hour** for panel work.

### Permit and Inspection ($125 - $250)
The City of Henderson requires an electrical permit for any panel upgrade. The fee covers the application and one inspection. If the inspector finds something that needs correction, re-inspection may cost extra.

### NV Energy Coordination ($0 - $200)
NV Energy has to pull your meter before the upgrade and reinstall it after. This involves:

- **Scheduling**: We coordinate with NV Energy 3-7 business days ahead
- **Meter pull and reconnect**: NV Energy sends a tech to handle the meter
- **Service upgrade paperwork**: If you're increasing amperage, NV Energy verifies their service line and transformer can handle the higher load
- **Cost**: NV Energy does not charge residential customers for standard meter pulls. Fees may apply if their service line to your home needs upgrading.

### Power Outage During the Upgrade
Your home will be **without electricity for 4-8 hours** during the upgrade. Sometimes longer if we hit complications. Plan ahead:
- Charge phones and laptops the night before
- Keep the fridge closed -- a few hours is fine
- Make other plans if you work from home
- Let everyone in the house know

## 100A vs 200A: What Is the Difference?

### 100-Amp Service
Standard in homes built from the 1960s through the 1980s. It handles:
- Lighting throughout the house
- Standard kitchen appliances
- Small to mid-size central AC
- Electric water heater OR electric dryer (both running at once can overload it)

**100A cannot support:**
- An EV charger (40-60A) on top of normal household loads
- Large solar arrays
- Multiple high-draw appliances running at the same time
- A modern home with home office, media room, and smart systems

### 200-Amp Service
The current standard for new construction. 200A handles:
- Everything 100A does, plus
- Level 2 EV charger (40-60A)
- Solar panel system
- Hot tub or pool equipment
- Additional HVAC zones
- Workshop with power tools
- EV charging + solar + full household loads running simultaneously

**200A is the right call for most Henderson panel upgrades.** It covers current needs and leaves room for whatever you add next.

### Beyond 200A
Larger custom homes or high-demand setups (multiple EVs, big solar array, pool, spa, detached workshop) may need **320A or 400A service**. This is uncommon and costs $3,500-$6,000+ because it requires:
- Upgraded service from NV Energy (larger transformer or dedicated feed)
- CT (current transformer) metering
- Larger service entrance cable
- A meter pedestal instead of a wall-mounted meter base in some cases

## The Panel Upgrade Process in Henderson

### Step 1: Assessment and Quote (Day 1)
We visit your home to:
- Inspect your current panel (brand, amperage, condition, available spaces)
- Run a load calculation to determine required capacity
- Assess the service entrance (meter base, service cable, weatherhead)
- Evaluate the route from meter to panel and flag any complications
- Provide a written, itemized quote

### Step 2: Permit Application (Days 2-3)
We submit the electrical permit application to the City of Henderson with a one-line diagram showing the new panel specs.

### Step 3: Permit Approval (Days 3-8)
Henderson's building department reviews and approves the permit. Panel upgrades take **3-5 business days** for approval.

### Step 4: NV Energy Coordination (Days 5-14)
We schedule the meter disconnect with NV Energy **3-7 business days** in advance. NV Energy confirms the date and time window.

### Step 5: Installation Day
Our crew arrives and completes the upgrade:

1. NV Energy pulls the meter (morning, usually by 8-9 AM)
2. Remove old panel and disconnect all circuits
3. Install new meter base (if required)
4. Mount and wire new panel
5. Transfer all existing circuits to new breakers
6. Run new service entrance cable from meter to panel
7. Update grounding to current NEC requirements
8. Test every circuit
9. Label all breakers
10. NV Energy reinstalls the meter and restores power (same day, occasionally next morning)

### Step 6: Inspection (1-3 Days After Installation)
We request an inspection from the City of Henderson. The inspector checks:
- Panel installation and workmanship
- Wire sizing and breaker ratings
- Grounding and bonding
- NEC compliance
- Breaker labeling

### Total Timeline: 2-3 Weeks
Assessment to passed inspection takes **2-3 weeks**. The physical work happens in one day -- permits and NV Energy scheduling account for the rest.

## Panel Upgrade + EV Charger: Do Them Together

If you need both, bundling saves money and hassle:

**Cost comparison:**
- Separate projects: $3,500 (panel) + $1,500 (charger) = $5,000
- Combined project: $4,200-$4,800 (save $200-$800 on overlapping labor)

**Combined project benefits:**
- One permit instead of two
- One NV Energy coordination
- One inspection
- One power outage instead of two
- We plan the panel layout around the EV circuit from the start

**Timeline**: Still 2-3 weeks. The charger install adds about 1-2 hours to installation day.

## Choosing an Electrician for a Panel Upgrade

This is not a job to hand off to the cheapest bid. Here is what matters:

- **Nevada State Contractors Board (NSCB) license**: Verify at nscb.nv.gov -- look for a C-2 (electrical) license
- **Insurance**: General liability and workers' comp
- **Panel upgrade experience**: Ask how many they have done. This should be routine work for any qualified shop.
- **NV Energy knowledge**: They should handle NV Energy coordination as part of the job, not leave it to you
- **Written, itemized quote**: Equipment, labor, permit fees, and contingencies broken out
- **Warranty**: At least 1 year on workmanship (we offer 3 years)
- **References**: Ask for recent Henderson panel upgrade customers

**Walk away if you see:**
- No NSCB license or refusal to share it
- "We can skip the permit to save you money" -- this is the biggest red flag in residential electrical work
- Quotes far below market rate (cutting corners on materials or workmanship)
- Pressure to sign without a written quote

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does a panel upgrade require a permit in Henderson?
Yes. The City of Henderson classifies a panel upgrade as a major residential electrical project. A licensed electrician pulls the permit, and the city inspects the finished work. Skipping the permit creates insurance problems and can block a future home sale.

### How long will my power be out during the upgrade?
Plan for 4-8 hours. NV Energy pulls the meter in the morning and reinstalls it the same day in most cases. We work straight through to minimize downtime.

### Will a panel upgrade increase my home's value?
Yes. A 200A panel is expected in today's market. Buyers and home inspectors flag 100A panels, especially if the home has modern loads like EV charging, solar, or a hot tub. A panel upgrade removes a common objection during a sale.

### Can I claim the panel upgrade on the federal 30C tax credit?
If the panel upgrade is required for your EV charger installation, the upgrade cost can be included in your 30C tax credit claim (30% of total cost, up to $1,000). Save the itemized invoice -- your CPA will need it.

### What panel brands do you install?
We use Square D, Siemens, and Eaton. All three are UL listed, widely available in Clark County, and have strong track records. We choose the brand that fits your home's specific needs and NV Energy requirements.
