  content: `## Do You Need a Permit for EV Charger Installation in Nevada?

**Yes.** Nevada requires an electrical permit for every Level 2 EV charger installation. Hardwired wall charger, new 240-volt outlet -- doesn't matter. The permit requirement applies whether a licensed electrician does the work or you do it yourself.

I know permits feel like red tape. But as someone who has seen the aftermath of unpermitted electrical work, the permit exists for good reason. An inspector checks that the wiring won't start a fire, that your insurance stays valid, and that you won't have problems at closing when you sell the house.

## Which Jurisdiction Handles Your Permit?

Your permit office depends on your exact address in the Las Vegas Valley:

### City of Henderson
If your home is within Henderson city limits, you apply through the **City of Henderson Community Development Department**. Henderson runs its own building department, separate from Clark County.

- **Apply online**: Henderson's online permit portal
- **In person**: Henderson City Hall, 240 S Water St, Henderson, NV 89015
- **Phone**: (702) 267-1500

### Clark County (Unincorporated Areas)
If you live in an unincorporated area of Clark County (parts of the valley outside city limits), permits go through the **Clark County Department of Building and Fire Prevention**.

- **Apply online**: Clark County's online permit system
- **In person**: 4701 W Russell Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89118
- **Phone**: (702) 455-8000

### City of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Boulder City
Each city has its own building department. If you are unsure which jurisdiction covers your address, your electrician will know.

At Henderson EV Charger Pros, we handle the full permit process -- application, installation, and inspection scheduling. Call (702) 555-0134 or fill out the form on our homepage for a free estimate.

## What Type of Permit Do You Need?

For a residential EV charger installation, you need an **electrical permit**. The category depends on the scope of work:

### Standard EV Charger Installation
- **Permit type**: Electrical permit (minor residential)
- **Covers**: New 240V circuit from your existing panel to the charger location, mounting the charger or outlet, all associated wiring
- **Fee**: $75 - $150 in Henderson
- **Turnaround**: 1-3 business days for approval, inspection within 48 hours of request

### Panel Upgrade + EV Charger
- **Permit type**: Electrical permit (major residential)
- **Covers**: Upgrading your electrical panel (e.g., 100A to 200A) plus the EV charger circuit
- **Fee**: $125 - $250 in Henderson
- **Turnaround**: 3-5 business days for approval
- **Extra step**: NV Energy must be notified for meter disconnect/reconnect

### New Construction or Major Renovation
If the EV charger is part of new home construction or a major remodel, it folds into the overall building permit rather than a separate electrical permit.

## The Permit Process: Step by Step

This is what the process looks like for a standard Henderson EV charger installation:

### Step 1: Application (Day 1)
Your electrician submits the permit application with:
- Property address and owner information
- Scope of work description (e.g., "Install 60A circuit for Tesla Wall Connector in attached garage")
- Simple electrical diagram showing the circuit from panel to charger
- Electrician's Nevada State Contractors Board (NSCB) license number
- Proof of insurance

We handle this entire process as part of every installation.

### Step 2: Permit Approval (Days 1-5)
The building department reviews the application. For straightforward EV charger installs, Henderson approves permits within **1-3 business days**. Panel upgrades or subpanels may take up to 5 business days.

Some jurisdictions offer **same-day or next-day** approval for simple electrical permits through an over-the-counter process.

### Step 3: Installation (After Permit Approval)
Once approved, the electrician performs the installation. A standard Level 2 charger install takes **2-4 hours**. The permit placard is posted at the job site during the work.

### Step 4: Inspection Request (Same Day or Next Day)
After installation, your electrician calls the building department to schedule an inspection. In Henderson, inspections are available **within 24-48 hours** of the request.

### Step 5: Inspection (1-2 Days After Request)
A city electrical inspector visits your home and checks:
- **Wire sizing** matches the circuit amperage (e.g., 6-gauge for 48A)
- **Breaker** is properly rated and installed
- **Connections** are tight, properly torqued, and meet NEC standards
- **Grounding** is correct
- **Charger mounting** is secure and at proper height
- **GFCI protection** is present where required (outdoor installations, certain garage configurations)
- **Conduit and wire protection** meets code
- **Panel labels** identify the new circuit

The inspection takes **15-30 minutes**. If everything passes, you get a green tag. If there are issues, the inspector notes corrections, and a re-inspection is scheduled after we fix them.

### Step 6: Final Approval
Once the inspection passes, your permit closes and the installation is on record. This matters for:
- Your homeowner's insurance
- Future home sales (buyers and inspectors can verify permitted work)
- Any future electrical work on your home

## What Code Requirements Apply?

EV charger installations in Nevada must comply with the **National Electrical Code (NEC)** as adopted by the state, plus any local amendments. The key NEC articles:

### NEC Article 625 - Electric Vehicle Power Transfer System
The primary code section for EV charging:
- **Dedicated circuit**: The EV charger must be on its own branch circuit with no shared loads
- **Disconnecting means**: An accessible way to disconnect the charger must exist
- **Ventilation**: Not required for Level 2 chargers in residential garages (this was a concern with older lead-acid battery vehicles, not modern lithium-ion EVs)

### NEC Article 210 - Branch Circuits
- **Continuous load rule**: EV chargers are continuous loads (operate 3+ hours). The circuit must be rated at **125% of the charger's maximum draw**. A 48A charger requires a 60A circuit (48 x 1.25 = 60).
- **Wire sizing**: Must match the breaker rating and account for voltage drop on long runs

### NEC Article 250 - Grounding
- All EV charging equipment must be properly grounded
- Equipment grounding conductor sized per Table 250.122

### Nevada-Specific Amendments
Nevada adopts the NEC with state-specific amendments. As of 2026, Nevada follows the **2023 NEC** with state amendments. Any licensed Nevada electrician will be current on these.

## What Happens If You Skip the Permit?

Some homeowners try to skip the permit to save $75-$150. That $75 can turn into a $75,000 problem. Here is why:

### Insurance Denial
If an electrical fire starts from unpermitted work, your homeowner's insurance company can **deny the claim**. That leaves you personally liable for the full damage -- potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars.

### Selling Your Home
When you sell, the buyer's inspector or appraiser will spot the EV charger and ask for permit records. Unpermitted work can:
- **Kill the sale outright**
- **Force a retroactive permit** (which means opening walls for inspection -- far more expensive than the original permit)
- **Lower your home's appraised value**

### Safety
The inspection exists to catch wiring mistakes that cause:
- Electrical fires from undersized wire
- Shock hazards from bad grounding
- Overloaded panels that overheat
- Code violations that create long-term risks

### Fines
Henderson and Clark County issue fines for unpermitted work. If discovered, you pay the original permit fee plus penalties, and the work gets inspected -- which may require partial disassembly.

## Can I Pull the Permit Myself?

Nevada law allows **homeowners to pull their own electrical permits** for work on their primary residence. You can do the installation yourself and have it inspected.

But there are real downsides:

- You must do the work yourself (you cannot hire an unlicensed person and pull the permit for them)
- The work still must pass inspection and meet all NEC requirements
- If you make a mistake, you pay to fix it
- Your homeowner's insurance may not cover DIY electrical work
- You lose the workmanship warranty a licensed electrician provides
- 240V electrical work is dangerous -- wiring errors can cause serious injury or death

Hire a licensed electrician. The cost difference between professional installation and true DIY (once you buy tools and materials) is $200-$400. That buys you a job done right, a warranty, and no risk of electrocution.

## How Long Does the Full Process Take?

For a standard EV charger installation in Henderson with no panel upgrade:

| Step | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| Permit application | Day 1 |
| Permit approval | Days 1-3 |
| Installation | Day 3-5 (2-4 hours of work) |
| Inspection request | Same day as installation |
| Inspection | 1-2 days after request |
| **Total** | **5-8 business days from start to finish** |

Panel upgrades add 1-2 weeks for NV Energy coordination.

## Permit Requirements for Commercial EV Chargers

Installing chargers at a business, parking garage, or multi-family property? The process is more involved:

- **Commercial electrical permit** (higher fees, detailed plans required)
- **ADA compliance** for accessible parking spaces with chargers
- **Fire department review** may be required
- **NV Energy commercial service** coordination for significant power additions
- **Site plan review** by the city planning department may be needed

Commercial installations require engineered electrical plans and take 2-4 weeks for permit approval.
